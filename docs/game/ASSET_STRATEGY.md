# Asset Strategy (Planning Only)

## Style directions
1. Cozy flat-cartoon (soft rounded UI, warm palette)
2. Clean minimal sim (neutral panels, high readability)
3. Playful sticker style (bold outlines, simple micro-anim)

## Asset categories needed
- UI kit: panels, buttons, bars, badges
- Icons: needs, items, status effects
- Backgrounds: room/day-night variants
- Pet animation set: idle/happy/tired/hungry/sick placeholders
- FX micro-elements: pulse/glow/pop hints

## Candidate sources (do not import yet)
- Unity Asset Store free UI packs (single style only)
- Kenney-style free 2D UI/icon packs
- Self-generated placeholder sprites/shapes for prototyping

## Rule: do not mix styles
Pick one style direction per phase milestone; avoid blending mismatched iconography/UI sets.
